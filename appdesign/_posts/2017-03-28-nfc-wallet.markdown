According to Wikipedia, Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other.

NFC is quite useful. You can use NFC for social networking, for sharing contacts, photos, videos. Now many smartphones are NFC devices.

Therefore, in the course "Crossmedia" in 2014, our teacher let us design something with NFC technology. At that time, there was still no NFC wallet app for all platforms, so I decided to make one.

In my design, you can not only purchase with NFC wallet but also withdraw cash and transfer money. The app also has an open platform to let the developers integrate the NFC wallet to other applications.

After defining all the functions, I designed the mockups in Adobe Photoshop.

I also made a prototype in Apple Keynote and exported it to a short video.
