Food waste is a huge global problem. According to FAO, roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tons — gets lost or wasted. In developing countries 40% of losses occur at post-harvest and processing levels while in industrialized countries more than 40% of losses happen at retail and consumer levels. 

What could we do to fight against the food waste? Could we share the extra food with others instead of throwing them away? That's why I designed FoodSociety. FoodSociety is a mobile App which provides a platform for people who want to share their food. 

FoodSociety is a project for my bachelor thesis at Trier University of Applied Science. I wrote the bachelor thesis in German and the language of the User Interface is also German. I designed the whole project on my own.

While designing the app I used the methods of User Experience Design like Persona, Scenario, and Service Journey Map. The app design is based on Material Design which is a design language developed by Google in 2014. And the prototype was made with InVision.
