My name is Jack Schwarz. I'm from China and now studying Intermedia Design in Trier University of Applied Science in Germany.

After I got the Bachelor degree in Computer Science in China in 2008, I started working as a Programmer in Beijing. In 5 years, I've not only worked for big companies such as Yahoo! and Taobao, but also for small Start-ups. My jobs were PHP development under Linux environment and Front-end Development, but I spent my spare time teaching myself Web Design and User Experience Design, because I always found it interesting. Therefore I came to Germany in 2013 to seek an opportunity to study Design.

During the study in Trier, I've gained a lot experience in various areas including Typography, Web Design, User Experience Design, and Motion Design. For my major project, I've made [a feature film](https://youtu.be/cBNyYMzHyOw) that lasts 70 minutes with almost no budget and experience in one year.

If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
