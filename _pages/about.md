My name is Jack Schwarz. I'm from China and now studying Intermedia Design in Hochschule Trier in Germany.

After I got the Bachelor degree in Computer Science in China in 2008, I started working as a Programmer in Beijing. In 5 years, I've not only worked for big companies such as Yahoo! and Taobao, but also for small Start-ups.  My jobs focused on PHP development under Linux environment and Front-end Development,  but I was very interested in Web Design and User Experience Design in my spare time. Therefore I came to Germany in 2013 to seek an opportunity to study Design.

Because I couldn't speak German at all when I arrived in Germany, I went to a language school in Cologne and passed the DSH (German language examination for university entrance) after 10 months. Then I came to Trier to study Intermedia Design.

During the study in Trier, I've gained much experience in various areas including Typography, Web Design, User Experience Design, and Motion Design. For the "Yearlong Project" of our major, I've made [a feature film](https://youtu.be/cBNyYMzHyOw) that lasts 70 minutes with almost no budget and experience.

If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
