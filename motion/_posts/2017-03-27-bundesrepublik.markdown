There were many refugees came to Germany in 2015, so in our "Audiovisual Media" course we made a series of videos to explain the laws, culture and many other things in Germany. My theme is "Bundesrepublik Deutschland" (Federal Republic of Germany).

I did the Motion Design and thanks to my classmate Daniel Jan√üen who did the voice over.
