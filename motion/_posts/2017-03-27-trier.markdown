There is a "Yearlong Project" in our major in Hochschule Trier. We can do anything related to the theme "Media". So I decided to make a feature film.

With Love in Trier tells a story between a Chinese student and a French girl. Alina, a girl from Paris, took a visit in Trier and met Jack, a Chinese student, at the freshmen party. They both thought the party was boring and went to the beautiful inner city of Trier to take a tour. During the tour, they talked lots of different topics.

I wrote, directed and produced this film. I was also the leading actor in the film. And I did all the post-productions on my own. Although there was almost no budget, I still got the film done on time. 

The film lasts 70 minutes. It takes us several months to finish it. I gained enormous experience from making the film. I learned lots of things like how to manage a crew, how to write a screenplay, how to draw storyboards, how to edit the film, how to do color grading, etc.
