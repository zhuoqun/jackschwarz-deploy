We have a typography course in the first semester. As the homework for this course, I've made two posters to play with different fonts.

<p>1. "You cannot find peace by avoiding life." by <em>Virginia Woolf</em>.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">
  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/quote1.jpg" title="You cannot find peace by avoiding life.">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/quote1-small.jpg" alt="You cannot find peace by avoiding life.">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
<p>2. "Taste is the enemy of the creativity." by <em>Pablo Picasso</em>.</p>

<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">
  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/quote2.jpg" title="Taste is the enemy of the creativity.">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/quote2-small.jpg" alt="Taste is the enemy of the creativity.">
        <p class="title">Poster #2</p>
    </a>
  </div>
