Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. All major modern web browsers have SVG support, so it's very useful if you want to create an animation in the browser.

I was interested in both typography and SVG, so I created this typography animation with the Snap.svg JavaScript Library.

**Preview**

<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">

  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/svg-animation.jpg" title="Preview">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/svg-animation.jpg" alt="In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.">
    </a>
  </div>

</div>
