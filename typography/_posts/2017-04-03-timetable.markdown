This is the homework for one of my courses. In the course, every student needed to find a timetable which is not well designed. Then we analyzed the bad design and attempted to improve it.

I chose the bus timetable in Trier. In my opinion, the timetable is difficult to understand. I take the bus almost every day and I'm always confused with it. I must read it for a while to make sure when the bus will come.

**The current timetable**

<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">

  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-old.jpg" title="Current Timetable">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-old-small.jpg" alt="Current Timetable">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

So I redesigned the bus timetable to make it easier to understand. I rearranged the elements and listed all the time clearly.

**After the redesign**

<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">

  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-redesign.jpg" title="Timetable Redesigned">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-redesign-small.jpg" alt="Timetable Redesigned">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

I also made an experimental version to explore the possibilities of presentation.

**The experimental version**
<div class="img-wrapper clearfix">

  <div class="img-container">
    <a class="content swipebox" href="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-experiment.jpg" title="Timetable Design Experiment">
        <img src="/assets/img/typography/content/timetable-experiment-small.jpg" alt="Timetable Design Experiment">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
