Amazon Kindle is one of the most popular e-readers in the world. It uses E Ink electronic paper which is very friendly to the eyes. Reading on Kindle is like reading physical books. 

But there is a problem with Kindle. Although you can add highlights and make notes while you're reading a book, the highlights and notes are not well formatted and organized. Kindle will just simply put them in a file named "My Clippings.txt". And if you're reading more than one book at once, all your highlights and notes will be mixed in "My Clippings.txt".

Therefore, I planned to make a website to help people to organize and manage the highlights and notes in "My Clippings.txt". You could directly import your "My Clippings.txt" into the website, then all the clippings in "My Clippings.txt" would be formatted and categorized by books. You could also add tags, edit the notes, or export your clippings as PDF or to Evernote.

Because I was already familiar with Front-end development, I designed the website directly with HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the browser. The prototype was built with the Twitter Bootstrap framework to benefit from its grid system and components. During the design process, I always considered making the website responsive and followed the "Mobile First" rule.

**Prototype**

<ul>
<li><a href="/demo/myclippings/index.html">Homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="/demo/myclippings/signin.html">Sign in</a></li>
<li><a href="/demo/myclippings/manager.html">Clippings Manager (2-Column Version)</a></li>
<li><a href="/demo/myclippings/manager-3column.html">Clippings Manager (3-Column Version)</a></li>
</ul>

I've also tried to implement the website with Ruby on Rails.
