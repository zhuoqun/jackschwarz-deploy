Every year, thousands of movies are produced and released around the world. We all have seen lots of movies in our life. We may not love the same movies, but we're all movie fans.

I love watching movies, so I made the website for movie fans like me. The idea is quite simple: You guess the name of the movie from the screenshots or the quotes posted by other people, then the uploader will choose the correct answer. Besides, you can also collect the screenshots/quotes you like, share the screenshots/quotes, and comment on other people's answer.

Because one of the basic elements is the screenshots, I borrowed the layout and "infinite scroll" feature from Pinterest. At first, I made a prototype with Twitter Bootstrap in the browser. Then I finished the website using Ruby on Rails (3.2.3). 

The product was completed in 4 months in my spare time. I did all the work on my own, includes graphic design, database design, prototype, Ruby on Rails, deployment, etc. I've gained lots of experience from developing this website.
