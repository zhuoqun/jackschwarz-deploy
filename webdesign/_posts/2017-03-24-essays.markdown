In 2011, I had a Chinese blog based on Wordpress. There were many Wordpress themes, but I still couldn't find a good one which is clean and friendly to Chinese typography. Therefore, I wrote the theme, "Essays".

The theme is quite simple. It has no fancy and complicated features so that you can focus on writing good articles. The layout and typography were carefully chosen to make the Chinese characters look more elegant.
