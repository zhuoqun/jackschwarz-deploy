Let's say you have a crush one someone. You want to ask if he or she has the same feeling for you. But you're afraid that the question would break your friendship. 

_Say Love_ is going to solve this difficult problem. It works in this way: On _Say Love_, you can write a letter to someone you have a crush on, but the receiver doesn't know you wrote the letter until he or she write a letter to you either.

You can also make your letter public, then other users will see your letter, of course, without your name on it. All public letters will be displayed on the website.

_Say Love_ was designed with Twitter Bootstrap in the browser. Some graphic elements were drawn by my friend Lin. I did all other design work and developed the website using Ruby on Rails.
